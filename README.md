# Skyrim Voicelines
This is a transcription of all voiced dialogue in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
All the dialogue audio files in the game were extracted from [Unofficial High Definition Audio Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18115) with [Bethesda Archive Extractor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/974), converted into WAVE format using [Unfuzer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19242), and finally transcribed with [Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper).

Each line contains plugin name, audio file name, voicetype and transcription.
## Why?
This can be useful for modders who are still making dialogue with voice splicing and cannot (or refuse to) use ElevenLabs or other voice synthesizer for whatever reason. You can feed this file into an excel sheet, filter the voicetype you need and find specific words/phrases.
## Note
Because AI model is imperfect, there will be mistakes, especially in names of characters, places, etc.
This is very noticable in lines that contain grunts, screams, shouts, and lines of dragons, dragon priests, rieklings, draugr.
I fixed some mistakes, but I didn't proofread the entire file, because that would be an insane thing to do. If you have the time to proofread the file and fix transcription errors - pull requests are welcome.
